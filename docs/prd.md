# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Structural Design Tool

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a **Structural Design Tool** aimed at simplifying and automating the design of concrete structures, particularly slabs, for both beginners and professionals in the Korean construction industry. The tool will provide user-friendly interfaces, automated calculations, and visual outputs that adhere to KDS (Korean Design Standards) regulations.

---

## Objectives
1. **Educational Value**: Help users understand the principles and standards behind structural design calculations.
2. **Efficiency**: Automate complex calculations and generate accurate design outputs.
3. **Traceability**: Provide clear calculation steps and visual representations as documentation.
4. **User-Friendliness**: Offer an intuitive interface that caters to both beginners and experienced practitioners.

## Key Features

### 1. **Input Data Interface**
- Allow users to input the following data:
  - Material properties:
    - Concrete compressive strength (\( f'_c \))
    - Reinforcement yield strength (\( f_y \))
    - Concrete unit weight (\( œÅ \))
  - Design conditions:
    - Span length (\( L \))
    - Slab type (e.g., one-way, two-way, continuous, cantilever)
    - Design loads (self-weight, live load, dynamic load, environmental load)
  - Code-related parameters:
    - Safety factors
    - Deflection limits
    - Cover thickness

### 2. **Automated Calculations**
- Perform calculations based on input data:
  - Bending moments and shear forces
  - Deflection and reinforcement area
  - Verification against KDS standards
- Provide detailed step-by-step breakdowns of all calculations.

### 3. **Visual Output**
- Generate:
  - Reinforcement layout drawings (e.g., bar arrangement and spacing)
  - Cross-sectional views of the slab
- Include dimension annotations and material specifications.

### 4. **Export Functionality**
- Allow users to export:
  - Calculation reports in PDF format
  - Design drawings as PNG, JPEG, or DXF files
  - Full project summary as a zip file containing all outputs

### 5. **Educational Mode**
- Offer tooltips and explanations for:
  - Input parameters
  - Calculations performed
  - Relevant code clauses

### 6. **User Experience Enhancements**
- Provide:
  - Real-time error checks for invalid inputs
  - Preset templates for common scenarios
  - Language support (initially Korean, with potential for English expansion)

## User Workflow
1. **Login/Access**:
   - User accesses the tool via a web interface or standalone software.
2. **Input Data**:
   - Users fill in required parameters in an intuitive form.
   - Option to use presets for standard slab types.
3. **Calculation Execution**:
   - Tool performs calculations and highlights any errors or warnings.
   - Displays intermediate steps for educational transparency.
4. **Results Visualization**:
   - Users view generated designs and diagrams.
   - Option to adjust parameters and recalculate.
5. **Export**:
   - Users download results as PDFs or images for documentation.

## Technical Specifications
- **Programming Language**: Python (backend) and React (frontend)
- **Frameworks**:
  - Flask/Django for backend API
  - Matplotlib/Plotly for visualizations
  - CAD libraries (e.g., ezdxf) for drawings
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing user projects and input data
- **Deployment**: Cloud-based (AWS or Azure) or standalone

---

## Success Metrics
1. **User Engagement**: Measure active usage by beginners and professionals.
2. **Accuracy**: Ensure all calculations align with KDS standards.
3. **Usability**: Achieve high satisfaction scores from users in beta testing.
4. **Educational Impact**: Gather feedback on learning outcomes for new users.

---

## Future Features
- Integration with BIM software for advanced modeling.
- Support for non-slab structures (e.g., beams, columns).
- Multi-language support and international standards (e.g., ACI, Eurocode).
- Mobile app development for on-site usage.
