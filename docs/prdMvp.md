## Key Features

### 1. **Input Data Interface**
- Basic input for:
  - Concrete compressive strength (\( f'_c \))
  - Reinforcement yield strength (\( f_y \))
  - Span length (\( L \))
  - Slab type (e.g., one-way, two-way)

### 2. **Automated Calculations**
- Perform essential calculations:
  - Bending moments
  - Shear forces
  - Basic reinforcement area

### 3. **Visual Output**
- Generate simple reinforcement layout drawings.

### 4. **Export Functionality**
- Export calculation reports in PDF format.

### 5. **User Experience Enhancements**
- Real-time error checks for invalid inputs.
